Certainly! I'll provide explanations for each function in the modified code:

1. `create_table(self)`: This method is responsible for creating the SQLite table if it doesn't exist. The table has columns for task id, task name, date, and priority.

2. `add_task(self)`: Adds a new task to the database. It retrieves task details (name, date, priority) from the user input fields and inserts them into the SQLite database.

3. `update_task_listbox(self)`: Updates the task listbox with tasks retrieved from the database. It sorts tasks by priority and displays them in the listbox.

4. `complete_task(self)`: Marks a task as completed. It deletes the selected task from the database based on the user's selection in the listbox.

5. `delete_task(self)`: Deletes a task from the database. It removes the selected task based on the user's selection in the listbox.

6. `save_tasks(self)`: In the SQLite implementation, saving tasks is not required, as the database is persistent. It shows a message indicating that the tasks are saved.

7. `load_tasks(self)`: In the SQLite implementation, loading tasks is not required, as the tasks are stored in the database. It shows a message indicating that the tasks are loaded.

8. `show_about_info(self)`: Displays information about the application, explaining how tasks are categorized by color and how to use the app. It also shows details about the authors and the current date.

9. `get_current_date(self)`: Returns the current date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

These methods are part of the `TodoApp` class and handle different aspects of the to-do application, including task management, database interactions, and user interface updates.
